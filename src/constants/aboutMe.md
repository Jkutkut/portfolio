# About Me

I'm Jorge (Jkutkut on the internet), a passionate software developer always looking for new challenges.
My journey in programming began as a self-taught enthusiast, progressively advancing my skills through
independent learning, my formal education and courses.

I love to learn new things, geek about the latest technologies and share my knowledge with others.
I am learning more and more everyday thanks to all the content on internet and this is my way of paying back:
I will host all the non private code I make over the years, so everyone interested can see the code and (hopefully) learn as well.

Currently, I am working as a Tech Lead while developing my own open-source projects here. Feel free to check them out and/or reach out :)
